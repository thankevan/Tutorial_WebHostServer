# Step 1. Default Nginx

The `run_this.sh` script will get Nginx up and running in Docker (you need to have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) already).

The script is heavily documented/commented. It covers:
 - pulling new images, 
 - finding images that have been downloaded,
 - running containers from images,
 - "logging into" running containers, and
 - cleaning up old containers and images.
